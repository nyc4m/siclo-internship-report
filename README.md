# Intership Report at Siclo Mobile

This is my Intership report at siclo mobile, built with latex

## dependency

This report relies on this [latex class](https://github.com/PymZoR/utt-ST09-ST10) which provides a UTT report template :slightly_smiling_face:

## Build
to build the project, you need latex. I use latexmk to make things easier.

```
latexmk -pdf //will compile everything in pdf
```
